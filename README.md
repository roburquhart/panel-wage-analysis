Analysis of wage data for youth from four panels of the NIDS CRAM survey
This notebook explores data regarding households and livelihoods and the impact of the coronavirus. NIDS (National Income Dynamics Study) is a nationally (South African) representative panel survey following the trajectories of people over a period of time. At the height of the coronavirus, the database was purposed to collect particular information about the impact of the coronavirus (CRAM - Coronavirus Rapid Mobile Survey.) In particular I have used the data to understand income earned by youth, with a view to understanding how youth earnings may have been impacted by South Africa's lockdown responses to the virus.
